# Job-Market-Analysis-WDL-Hackathon

## Introduction

Welcome to the Youth Employment Trends in the IT Sector Analysis project! This repository contains the code and resources used to explore and analyze youth employment trends within the IT sector, focusing on Kenya. The project aims to uncover insights and provide recommendations for stakeholders in the job market.

## Project Overview

As a Data Scientist passionate about data and its impact, I embarked on this project to delve into the dynamics of youth employment in the IT sector. The project's main goals include:

- Analyzing data to identify trends and patterns in youth employment within the IT sector.
- Creating data visualizations to showcase significant insights.
- Offering strategic recommendations for policymakers, businesses, and stakeholders based on findings.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured methodology involving data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques. The primary tools and libraries used include:

- Python: The core programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- pandas and NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.
- Plotly Express: A powerful library for interactive data visualization.
- scikit-learn: Used for implementing machine learning models and cross-validation.

## Data Selection and Processing

- Selected variables include 'Country,' 'Sex,' 'Sector,' 'Year,' and 'Observed value' to capture youth employment trends.
- Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- The 'Year' variable was filtered to include data from 2015 to 2024.
- Categorical variables were one-hot encoded for analysis.

## Results

- Interactive visualizations were developed using Plotly  to visualize job market trends.
- Population trends, unemployment rates, and sector distribution are showcased through interactive visualizations.
- The visualization addresses the project's goal of uncovering insights into youth employment within the IT sector.
- A predictive model was built to help project future trends

## Findings and Insights

- Agriculture and the service industries proved to be the sectors with the most youth employees, one can say it's due to the energy needed in those sectors.
- Fluctuations in sector-specific observed values hinted at shifts in demand and supply dynamics within the different countries.
- The exploration unearthed gender discrepancies in sector involvement, signifying areas for intervention.

## Recommendations and Impact

- Policymakers are recommended to implement inclusive strategies to foster gender diversity in the IT job market.
- Collaboration between academia and industry is suggested to bridge skill gaps and align education with industry demands.
- The project's insights have the potential to catalyze a more inclusive, prosperous, and sustainable youth workforce.

## Conclusion

This project encapsulates the journey of analyzing youth employment trends within Kenya's Job market. The insights gained and recommendations provided serve as valuable resources for stakeholders aiming to shape the future of the job market in this case especially the IT sector.

Feel free to explore the code, visualizations and model within this repository and contribute to enhancing our understanding of youth employment dynamics.
